## README.md

This is the README.md for the CrossProduct program; done for a coding assignment that was unfinished.

## Intention of program, main methods/variables, and classes

As mentioned, the CrossProduct program was an unfinished coding assignment. As stated throughout the code, the intention of the program is to return (print out) the kth term of the CrossProduct array, which is sorted by smallest to greatest cross product. 

### Main methods and variables
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
